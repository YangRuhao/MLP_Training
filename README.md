# MLP_Training

# Overview

This project involves implementing a basic Multi-Layer Perceptron (**MLP**), a type of Artificial Neural Network (**ANN**) designed to solve various tasks including XOR, sinusoidal regression, and letter recognition. It showcases an end-to-end pipeline: initializing the model, training it on specific datasets, and evaluating its performances. 

# Features
- Feedforward Mechanism that computes predictions using matrix multiplications and sigmoid activations.
* Backpropagation that calculates errors, deltas, and weight updates using the sigmoid derivative.
+ Training and Evaluation on different datasets
- Uses data pre-processing steps and one-hot encoding for dataset handling.

# Installation 
```
git clone https://github.com/YangRuhao/MLP_Training.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This project was done on Jupyter Notebook, but it can be done on other computing platforms, like Intellij or VScode.
