# MLP_Training

# Overview

This project involves implementing a basic Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), a type of ANN designed to solve various tasks including XOR, sinusoidal regression, and letter recognition. It showcases an end-to-end pipeline: initializing the model, training it on specific datasets, and evaluating its performances. 

# Features
1. Feedforward Mechanism that computes predictions using matrix multiplications and sigmoid activations.
2. Backpropagation that calculates errors, deltas, and weight updates using the sigmoid derivative.
3. Training and Evaluation on different datasets
4. Uses data pre-processing steps and one-hot encoding for dataset handling.
